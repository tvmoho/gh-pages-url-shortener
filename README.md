# M√òH√òtv - Encurtador de Links

Um Encurtador de Links (para uso interno) que pode ser totalmente hospedado no Github.

## üë®‚Äçüè´ Demo

1. [tvmoho.github.io/link/1](https://tvmoho.github.io/link/1) vinculado a este reposit√≥rio.

1. Para encurtar um novo link, crie uma issue com o link √† ser encurtado como t√≠tulo da issue... 
   [https://github.com/tvmoho/link/issues](https://github.com/tvmoho/link/issues).

1. O novo link pode ser acessado digitando `tvmoho.github.io/link/{issue_number}`

## ‚òïÔ∏è Features

1. Unlike many URL shorteners, this one ~~does not need a database~~ uses a
   "database" in the form of GitHub issues and can be entirely hosted on GitHub
   pages.

1. There is no need for the pound symbol - short URLs look clean like this:
   `nlsn.cf/1` instead of looking like this: `nlsn.cf/#1`.

## üí° How does this work?

_Thanks to @kidGodzilla for the pretty neat explanation
[here](https://github.com/nelsontky/gh-pages-url-shortener/issues/5#issuecomment-728040879)._

> 1. 404.html handles all requests
> 1. Small javascript snippet fetches a JSON representation of the GitHub issue
>    via the JSON API, and redirects to the issue title, as a URL.
> 1. Profit?

## üòé This is so cool! How can I use this with my own domain?!

_Disclaimer: This method of creating a URL shortener is hacky and not meant to
be reliable. Do proceed at your own risk!_

1. Fork the repo before cloning your fork.
1. Set up GitHub pages for your forked repo.
   1. In your forked repo, **click the Settings tab** and scroll down to the
      GitHub Pages section.
   1. Then select the **main branch** source and click on the **Save** button.
   1. <img src="https://i.imgur.com/kjinFX9.png" alt="How to create GitHub page" height="176px">
1. If you are using your own domain:
   1. [Set your domain up for GitHub pages.](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site#configuring-an-apex-domain)
   1. Change the URL in `CNAME` file to your domain.
1. If you are using GitHub page's default domain i.e. Something like
   `https://<username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`
   1. Delete the `CNAME` file.
   1. Change `var PATH_SEGMENTS_TO_SKIP = 0;` at the top of `404.html` to
      `var PATH_SEGMENTS_TO_SKIP = 1;`.
      1. This is as GitHub domains have an additional path segment (the repo
         name) after the host name.
1. Create a new repo as a database. (Or you could use your forked repo)
   1. Update `var GITHUB_ISSUES_LINK = "<your-github-issues-link>";` at the top
      of `404.html` accordingly afterwards.
      1. Format for `GITHUB_ISSUES_LINK`:
         `https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/`
      1. Remember the trailing `/`!
1. Push your changes to your forked repo, and your low cost and cool as heck URL
   shortener will be ready for use!
